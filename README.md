# Connected-Irrigation-System

We have developed an irrigation system controlled by a mobile application that utilizes the Firebase database. This solution allows for remote control of the irrigation system from the mobile application. Users can access various functionalities, such as turning the irrigation system on and off, adjusting water flow settings, and scheduling irrigation timings. All system usage data is stored in the Firebase database, enabling real-time monitoring of irrigation activities and facilitating data-driven decision-making.

The connected irrigation system prototype offers convenience and flexibility to farmers, as they can remotely manage and monitor their irrigation processes. By using the mobile application, farmers have greater control over water usage, ensuring efficient irrigation practices and minimizing water wastage. The integration with the Firebase database allows for seamless data management, enabling users to access historical records and generate insightful reports on irrigation patterns and water consumption.

Overall, this prototype of a connected irrigation system offers an intelligent and user-friendly solution for optimizing irrigation processes, enhancing water management, and ultimately improving agricultural productivity.
